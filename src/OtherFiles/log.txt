log 7 - 2/13/24 - 2/16/24 - Dursen
  Implements GUI for the main login page of the app and the very first page of the calendar.
  Use case: Displaying motivational messages, was left for other iterations as it was simply an optional feature. Instead the first two pages needed for this app were designed.

	3:40PM - 10:00PM
  Added more test classes to check the following functionalities: 
  	1. Ordering of Year, Month, Day, and Event objects in their respective has-a relationships.
  	2. More Event and Day class integration testing.
  	3. Re-factoring in the NonRepeatingEventTesting class.
  Fully implemented the Reminder class and added the ReminderTest class to test it.
log 10 - 2/19/24 - Yadon
  3:40PM - 9:50PM
  Added Javadoc documentation comments for classes CalendarApp, CalendarException, Day, Event, EventOverlapException, ExternalEvent, Extracurricular, Hour, InvalidEventTimeException, InvalidReminderTimeException, LimitedTreeSet, Month, MonthNotFoundException, negativeReminderOffsetException  and their respective methods
  Fixed methods in the Hour and Day classes.
  Finalized UML class diagram of the project's business logic.
  Created CRC cards for all classes except  Assignment, Homework, Year, and RepeatingEvent
log 11 - 2/23/24 - Dursen
	2:00PM - 6:00PM
	Implemented and added a fully functioning signup and login page (both logic controllers and fxml ). 
	Added an initial homepage for the application.
log 12 - 2/25/24 - 2/26/24 - Yadon
	3:00PM - 3:00AM

log 14 - 3/10/24 - Yadon
	6:00PM - 5:00AM (3/11/24)
	Redesigning parts of the Business Logic for database integration and making database operation methods for the Month, Year, Hour, and Day classes.
log 15 - 3/10/24 - Yadon
	Changes in iteration 2 deliverables and extending the introduction of new features:
		- Issues Encountered:
			1. Database operation methods were faulty in different ways depending on each person's device. -Fully Resolved
			2. Relationship between Year, Month, Day, and Hour classes required complex Object Relational Mapping tools that would have taken a lot of 			time to integrate with the project. We got by most of these issues by redesigning the main parts of the business logic. -Partially Resolved.
			3. Redesigning the business logic prevented us from implementing one of the features that were supposed to be added in this iteration. 				Automatic event adding was not implemented as the business logic had to be redesigned to allow for consistent database related operations. 				- Resolved by extending the introduction of some features to next iterations. 
	Features and functionalities that were supposed to be finalized for this iterations:
		- UI and database integration for Homework/Assignment adding
		- UI and database integration of reminders
		- UI and database integration of time related classes and 
		- Event Rescheduling
		- Automatic event adding
		- Extra features for adding, removing and editing events
	Features that were pushed to next iteration:
		- Event Rescheduling
		- Automatic Event Adding
	Features that were implemented differently due to redesign of parts of the business 		logic:
		- Event viewing(feature wasn't specifically implemented for each day, rather it 		was implemented to appear on a portion of the GUI when a day was selected)
	Features that were fully or almost fully implemented:
		- UI and database integration for Homework/Assignment adding
		- UI and database integration of reminders
		- UI and database integration of time related classes and
